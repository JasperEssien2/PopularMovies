# PopularMovies
Popular movie is an app that gets the list of movies either by top rated or most popular (User's choice) or through search done by user and then displays it in a gridview, each item when clicked displays the movie details.

## Motivation
This is the second project for udacity's android nanodegree program students. The project aims at being able to call Api(s) in this case TheMovieDb Api and to display the data returned.

## Getting Started
To get started you'll need to get an APi key from theMovieDb API then initialize it in the API_KEY contant variable found in Contants/ApiConstant.java.

## API Used
TheMovieDb Api

## Librarys
Retrofit - For Api calls and to parse list of movies returned by Api.
